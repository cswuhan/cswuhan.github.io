Before today, I reflected on my past experiences. I struggled since junior school and lost my way in high school. 

Firstly, I need to review my work journal and determine if pursuing higher education is necessary. 

Nowadays, an undergraduate degree may not be enough, so I may need to take postgraduate exams.

 Secondly, I am at risk of losing my job because I lack the necessary skills and knowledge. I must learn quickly to avoid being fired. Thirdly, I need to prepare for a professional certification exam, such as the HUAWEI Certified Information Communications Technology Professional. Having a job is critical for me as I need money to survive.

The key to success in any job is learning the necessary knowledge and skills. To achieve this, I am currently focused on obtaining a professional certification: the HUAWEI Certified Information Communications Technology Professional. 

I understand that it is crucial to learn about the examination before preparing for it. Therefore, I plan to dedicate a few days to studying all the details of the exam, such as what HUAWEI Certification Information Communication Technology Professional is, why it's important, when to prepare for the exam, how long it will take me to study each period's knowledge, which books or study courses to purchase, and how to incorporate my goals into my daily routine.
