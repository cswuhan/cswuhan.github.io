Until today, I spent time reflecting on my previous experiences, particularly my struggles during junior and high school. My first step towards improvement is to review my work journal and assess whether pursuing higher education is necessary. With the current job market, an undergraduate degree may no longer suffice, and I may have to consider taking postgraduate exams. 

Additionally, I risk losing my job because I lack essential skills and knowledge. To avoid being fired, I need to learn quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, preparing for professional certification exams, such as the HUAWEI Certified Information Communications Technology Professional, is also crucial for advancing my career and increasing my job security. 

A job is essential to survive financially, and I am determined to take the necessary steps to improve my situation.

As someone who believes that the key to success in any job is acquiring the necessary knowledge and skills, I am currently focused on obtaining a professional certification: the HUAWEI Certified Information Communications Technology Professional. To be fully prepared for the exam, I understand that it is crucial to learn about the examination first. Therefore, I have planned to dedicate a few days to studying all the details of the exam, including what HUAWEI Certification Information Communication Technology Professional is, why it's important, when to prepare for the exam, how long it will take me to study each period's knowledge, which books or study courses to purchase, and how to incorporate my goals into my daily routine.

I recently had a chat with my closest friend, who has been in the workforce for quite some time now, and it's made me feel apprehensive about my job situation. It seems like the only solution is for me to buckle down and acquire all the necessary skills and knowledge as quickly as possible. I'm afraid that my frequent absences and inability to handle professional tasks could lead to my getting fired. Unfortunately, since I'm still on probation, I'm not making the same progress as my colleagues, who can self-study and solve work-related problems independently. It's a problematic situation, and I'm scared that I could lose my job.

To make matters worse, I just discovered that I'm in debt to the tune of ¥50,000. Repaying this sum will take a year, which may hinder my ability to prepare for the postgraduate entrance examination. All of these things combined have left me feeling overwhelmed.

I read an article named ‘2-Minute Rule to Become a Master at Coding — Atomic  Habits. “

The article by Halim Shams discusses how to stay motivated when learning programming and highlights the key points from James Clear's book "Atomic Habits." It emphasizes that building small, consistent habits is the key to success in programming. The article mentions the Habit Loop (Cue, Craving, Response, Reward) and how it can be used to build good and bad habits. It also suggests using the 2-Minute Rule to start small and gradually increase your programming efforts to prevent frustration and make a long-term learning habit.

I created a plan for a month and broke it down into weekly goals. This helped me to determine what to learn each day. To further organize my efforts, I also created a diary containing both weekly and monthly goals. This allowed me to stay on track with my program during each period.

I find that you can learn everything if you spend enough time. I was afraid to learn something interesting as I thought it might not be easy. So, I quit whenever I had a problem and was interrupted by work or other tasks.

I need to start by now. To build my learning habit, do it for 10 minutes. I will become a better learner and a better coder.

Tonight, I talked to a colleague in his 40s who has worked in his area for over twenty years. We discussed a lot, such as the military, economics, politics, life, and family.

As for me, I learned a lot.

Firstly, I need to figure out what to do next. To be a public servant? To be a preparation staff? To be a postgraduate? To be a developer? This is a big problem that may influence my life. I should spend time learning about each way as clearly as possible. To analyze each way's advantage and combine my family and my features.

Secondly, I focus on my study plans and pay more attention to the news, such as various area situations, national politics, world economics, and the military.

Perhaps I should start learning to code now. As the article suggests, dedicating 5 hours a day to learning CSS, HTML, JS, and other aspects of web development would be beneficial. However, the job market has become increasingly challenging, to the point where even someone with a top Ph.D. may struggle to find their desired career after a year of searching.
