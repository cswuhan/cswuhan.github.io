Until today, I spent time reflecting on my previous experiences, particularly my struggles during junior and high school. My first step towards improvement is to review my work journal and assess whether pursuing higher education is necessary. With the current job market, an undergraduate degree may no longer suffice, and I may have to consider taking postgraduate exams. 

Additionally, I risk losing my job because I lack essential skills and knowledge. To avoid being fired, I need to learn quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, preparing for professional certification exams, such as the HUAWEI Certified Information Communications Technology Professional, is also crucial for advancing my career and increasing my job security. 

A job is essential to survive financially, and I am determined to take the necessary steps to improve my situation.

As someone who believes that the key to success in any job is acquiring the necessary knowledge and skills, I am currently focused on obtaining a professional certification: the HUAWEI Certified Information Communications Technology Professional. To be fully prepared for the exam, I understand that it is crucial to learn about the examination first. Therefore, I have planned to dedicate a few days to studying all the details of the exam, including what HUAWEI Certification Information Communication Technology Professional is, why it's important, when to prepare for the exam, how long it will take me to study each period's knowledge, which books or study courses to purchase, and how to incorporate my goals into my daily routine.

I recently had a chat with my closest friend, who has been in the workforce for quite some time now, and it's made me feel apprehensive about my job situation. It seems like the only solution is for me to buckle down and acquire all the necessary skills and knowledge as quickly as possible. I'm afraid that my frequent absences and inability to handle professional tasks could lead to my getting fired. Unfortunately, since I'm still on probation, I'm not making the same progress as my colleagues, who can self-study and solve work-related problems independently. It's a problematic situation, and I'm scared that I could lose my job.

To make matters worse, I just discovered that I'm in debt to the tune of Â¥50,000. Repaying this sum will take a year, which may hinder my ability to prepare for the postgraduate entrance examination. All of these things combined have left me feeling overwhelmed.
