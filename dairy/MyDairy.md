Before today, I reflected on my past experiences. I struggled since junior school and lost my way in high school. 

Firstly, I need to review my work journal and determine if pursuing higher education is necessary. 

Nowadays, an undergraduate degree may not be enough, so I may need to take postgraduate exams.

 Secondly, I am at risk of losing my job because I lack the necessary skills and knowledge. I must learn quickly to avoid being fired. Thirdly, I need to prepare for a professional certification exam, such as the HUAWEI Certified Information Communications Technology Professional. Having a job is critical for me as I need money to survive.
